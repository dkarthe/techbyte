`With a 65-inch OLED 4K screen and all the smarts you can possible put into a TV today, the Sony KD-65A1 is a behemoth with the specs to boot. Here’s our review.`

<!---break--->

It’s possible to get a 65-inch TV at under Rs 75,000 today, and a lot of buyers have been opting for affordable brands simply for the benefits of a large screen. However, you often won’t find the best picture quality on these affordable TVs, and you might also find the resolution and features falling a bit short. For the best quality, you will want to turn to brands such as Sony, Samsung and LG among others, who adopt the latest technology and build arguably the best TVs you can buy.

Naturally, a flagship-grade TV will not come cheap. We reviewed the Rs 449,000 Samsung QLED TV a while ago, and came away impressed. Today, we’re looking at the most direct competitor to Samsung’s QLED lineup, the Sony KD-65A1 OLED 4K Smart TV. With the absolute best that can be offered from a TV, Sony has stepped up its game with the KD-65A1. Priced at Rs 464,900, this OLED TV from Sony promises a lot for the price. Find out if it’s worth that mammoth price tag in our review.

# Technologically advanced image and sound
  * As is usually the case with a high-end Sony TV, the KD-65A1 is full of the latest technology, and can be considered state-of-the-art by any standards. The TV has a 4K high dynamic range OLED screen. While OLED screens on smartphones are relatively common now, the technology is reserved for only the most premium TVs because of the higher cost of producing large OLED panels.

  * OLED does not use a typical backlit liquid crystal display, instead using an organic material that is illuminated when an electrical current is passed through it. Each OLED pixel therefore generates its own light, thereby allowing for better black levels due to the ability to shut off pixels entirely, as well as better colors across the spectrum. While LG has been in the business of OLED TVs for a while now, the KD-65A1 is Sony’s first effort at the new kind of display.

  * Another big change is the speakers, which, if you take a look around the TV, are nowhere to be seen. Yet, sound magically emanates from the TV, thanks to interesting new tech in place. Called acoustic surface, the speaker drivers are placed behind the screen, and sound actually comes out of the screen itself. The first taste of this technology was on last year’s Xiaomi Mi MIX, and the Sony KD-65A1 uses a similar implementation of the technology. The panel itself is porous enough for the sound to pass through unperturbed, and it’s as loud and clean as you’d expect from typical speakers.
  
# Picture perfect
 * Thanks to Sony’s top-end image processing and the quality of the 4K HDR OLED panel itself, picture is fantastic all around. I watched all kinds of content on the TV, including 4K-HDR, 4K, Full-HD and standard definition video, both through files as well as streamed from online services. Naturally, the best performance can be seen with 4K-HDR content, which boasts quite possibly the best colors I’ve seen on a modern television. The picture is natural, sharp, and has fluid motion. With the fight for doing HDR best heating up between Sony and Samsung, it seems that Sony has the edge this time. The KD-65A1 is in fact the best functional display of HDR you can buy today
 
 * Even with non-HDR content, the color is about as close to real as you can expect, with Sony’s superior processing and graphics-handling engine doing a fantastic job in color and resolution upscaling. Thanks to the size of the TV itself, it’s best enjoyed with 4K content. Upscaling with full-HD content is decent as well, and naturally this TV makes sense if you watch a lot of high-resolution content, using high-resolution sources such as an HD set-top box, Blu-Ray Player, modern gaming console or a high-resolution streaming service and plan.
